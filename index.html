      <p>1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="image">
      <p>2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,</p> 
      
      <p>3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>

    <section class="normal">
      <p>4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</p>

      <p>5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>

      <p>6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
      <p>7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
      <p>8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="normal">
      <p>9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>

      <p>10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>

      <p>11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
      
      <p>12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
